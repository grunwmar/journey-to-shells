# Martin's journey into unix shells
This project is about my learning journey of shells and the basics of different shells, experimentation, examples, and comparison. The Project is Markdown based i.e. project should gradually converge into some form of publication.

I will focus mainly on to 
[z-shell](https://www.zsh.org/) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)),
[bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))),
[(T) C shell](https://www.tcsh.org/) ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcsh))

Also I plan to add links to free materials about shell topic.
